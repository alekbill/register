    "description": "Will be used to allow me to access my self-hosted VPS instance when out and about, without needing to access it through the IP address. On VPS many projects: docker, Torrserve, Nginx and other. I need the wildcard subdomain to allow me to access the services that I host over secure https, without needing to get an alternative domain for it. For example, I can host the uptime monitor for my VPS on up.hks.localplayer.dev",
    "domain": "localplayer.dev",
    "subdomain": "hks",
